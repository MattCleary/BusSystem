## Software Design Project for Semeseter 3
We were assigned a task to develop a java application for a student grant system. The application needed a username and password to enter it. In the application a student was able to enter their details and the application would calculate what grant the student qualified for.
The application had to be able to let the college view how much they were due in grant fees. 
It also had to keep track of how many students used it,and how many of the people that used it received grants.
